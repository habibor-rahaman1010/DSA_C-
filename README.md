# Data Structure and Algorith using in c++ program.
# DSA_CPP

## Description about the repository...
### This is my data structure and algorithm repository.First of all i learnd basic c program.
### C basic learned data type | condition | if | else if | switch case | array | function |
### for loop | while loop | do while loop | pointer | structure | union | file read write operation |
### dynamic memory allocation | Malloc | Calloc | Realloc | and ast i was basic 150 problem solved.

## Currently i learing C++ program and drive into more. i covered all c concept in c++ program.

## Right now learn basic data structur and algorithm and solving problem verious online judge.

### C++ is gratest programming language for compitive programming. c++ is special eidition of c programming.
### c++ support STL which is good for dynamic data structure like vector. vector is dyanmic data structur so meny buildin funtion have vectro.

# Pray for me and following my repo it's help to lot of you.
